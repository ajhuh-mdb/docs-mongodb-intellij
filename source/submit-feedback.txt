Retrieving Logs for Bug Reports 
-------------------------------

Log files are important for diagnosing issues with the {+intellij-full+}. To 
retrieve 

To open a bug, logs are extremely important as IntelliJ is a complex platform 
and there are tons of edge cases. To retrieve logs, you'll need to open the Help 
menu in the toolbar and click on Collect Logs and Diagnostic Data. A warning 
pop up will appear mentioning that the collected information might contain 
sensitive data. This tool will generate a zip with the following contents:

General information about the IDE installation (version, host OS, host CPU, available memory, other plugins that might affect current functionality)
Thread dumps of the current state of IntelliJ. 
Internal state of the UI.
OpenTelemetry metrics from IntelliJ.
Logs of all the plugins, including ours.

Include this zip file as an attachment in the new ticket.
