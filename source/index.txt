The {+intellij-full+} is a tool designed to improve the development experience 
for Java developers working with IntelliJ IDEA. The {+intellij-short+} builds on 
the existing IntelliJ Database Explorer to streamline the process of writing 
and managing MongoDB queries directly within the IDE.

You can use the {+intellij-short+} to:

- Connect to your MongoDB instance and interact with your data. 

- Build and test Java queries faster.  

- Identify query and data modeling anti-patterns in your application code.

Features 
--------

The {+intellij-short+} currently supports the following features:

- :ref:`Autocomplete <intellij-autocomplete>` for database, collection, and 
  document field names. 

- :ref:`Type validation <intellij-type-validation>` of document fields.

- :ref:`Missing index warnings <intellij-index-warning>` for Java queries.

Get Started 
-----------

:ref:`intellij-install`
  Install the {+intellij-short+} from the JetBrains Marketplace.
